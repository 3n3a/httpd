This is the Git repo of the [Docker "Official Image"](https://github.com/3n3a/official-images#what-are-official-images) for [`httpd`](https://hub.docker.com/3n3a/httpd) (not to be confused with any official `httpd` image provided by `httpd` upstream). See [the Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/3n3a/httpd/) for the full readme on how to use this Docker image and for information regarding contributing and issues.

The [full image description on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/3n3a/httpd) is generated/maintained over in [the docker-library/docs repository](https://github.com/3n3a/docs), specifically in [the `httpd` directory](https://github.com/3n3a/httpd/tree/master/).

For outstanding `httpd` image PRs, check [PRs with the "library/httpd" label on the official-images repository](https://github.com/3n3a/official-images/labels/library%2Fhttpd). For the current "source of truth" for [`httpd`](https://hub.docker.com/3n3a/httpd), see [the `library/httpd` file in the official-images repository](https://github.com/3n3a/official-images/blob/master/library/httpd).
